# Direct-Access-Program

Our client, the UIC Bookstore is owned and operated by the University of Illinois at Chicago. In order to address the problem of the declining retail bookstore industry, the UIC bookstore introduced the Direct Access Program for the students. The Program grants students’ immediate access to discounted course materials in digital format. Worth noting, the pricing for the e-books is significantly reduced compared to the purchase of a printed textbooks. If the program is available for a class, students have access via Blackboard on day one of classes (for courses using access codes or eBook)

In this study you will see how we captured student's spending habits for course material over an academic semester. We constructed a survey for 300+ students on campus, gathered their responses and conducted statistical analysis on the collected data to build a solid set of recommendations outlining marketing strategies the University can use to increase adoption for DAP on campus. At the end of this study, you will see how each student can save $100-$200 (>50%) per semester on course material if they opt in for DAP.
